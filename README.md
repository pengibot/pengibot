## Hi there 👋, Welcome!

Hello! 👋 I am from Durham, England. 

I have a huge interest in Machine Learning 🤖 and coding 📃. Currently using Python 🐍, skikit-learn 🧪, pandas 🐼, Numpy 🔢 and Seaborn 🌊 to develop a model to predict chess ♟️ player's ELO's based on a single game 🕹️. 

Currently working 🧑‍💼 for the Office for National Statistics as a Software Engineer. Previous experience has been working at Reuters as a Java Developer and TsaAdvet as a C# Developer.
